## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project I put into practice HTML, CSS, media-query and learned that certain functionalities can be implemented in different ways.

### Continued development

The areas that I will continue to learn in order to implement better functionalities in future projects would be:
-JS
-Bootstrap
-React Js
-SASS

### Useful resources

I used chatGPT as a query tool (but not to give me the code done), with this tool I could efficiently search for concepts that I forgot and needed to implement in the development of the project.

This is an example of a search I needed
